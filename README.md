# Kakurasu


Vanilla HTML, JS, CSS implementation of the Japanese puzzle game [Kakurasu](http://susansmathgamesca.ipage.com/kakurasu/)

Current playable version of the game look outdated or contain ads.

There isn't source code of Kakursau implementations available online except for solvers via text format.


At the moment, it is playable, it lacks features like solving the board and leaderboards.
